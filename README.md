CS50 is a face-to-face and online computer science course at Harvard University.  

This course is divided into weeks, and each week has a central topic and problem to solve.  

I made this repository to show the things studied in this course.  

## Lecture 0 (Scratch)

The week 0 is about principles of computers world 
- How to computer representing data (yes, with binary) 
- What is a algorithms 
- Time to solve problems (the bigO notation)
- âœ¨Scratch âœ¨

### Problem Set 0

In this class, I learned about scratch, and the proposed set of problems was to create something with scratch, and i made a game.

My project is a retro game, similar to pong, but for one player. To play, click [here!](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/778158229/)

## Lecture 1 (C language)

In this class, i apprehended the fundamentals of programming with C, things already seen with Scratch, now using C and new concepts using this text-based language. (Correctness, Design, Style, Syntax, IDE, Compiling, Functions, Arguments, Return Values, Types, Operators, Variables and so on)

### Problem Set 1

In this week, have 2 problems to solve, the version of problem if you feel most confortable and if you feel less confortable too

### Mario Pyramids 

the first problem set, is based in make a mario pyramid, using c.  

| Mario less confortable version                | Program in c                                   |
|:---------------------------------------------:| ---------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="./assets/mario1.jpeg" width="300"/> |  <pre>$ ./mario           <br>Height: 4<br>   #<br>  ##<br> ###<br>####<br></pre> |

| Mario more confortable version               | Program in c                                   |
|:--------------------------------------------:| ---------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="./assets/mario2.png" width="300"/> | <pre>$ ./mario           <br>Height: 4<br>   #  #<br>  ##  ##<br> ###  ###<br>####  ####<br></pre> |

### Cash and Credit

The second problem set involves money ðŸ¤‘ (and it's not hack a ATM).

Cash is a greedy algorithm to minimize the number of coins youâ€™re dispensing for each customer when giving changes, the input are the value of change and the output are the number of coins you have to give.

| Cash                                        |
|---------------------------------------------|
| <pre>$ ./cash<br>Change Owed: -41               <br>Change Owed: foo<br>Change Owed: 41<br>4</pre> |


Credit is a credit card checker. the input are the credit card number is `INVALID` for invalid number, and if valid, the program check what is the flag of card, return `VISA`, `MASTERCARD` and `AMEX`.

| Credit                                      |
|---------------------------------------------|
|  <pre>$ ./credit <br>Number: 4003600000000014       <br>VISA<br>$ ./credit<br>Number: 371449635398431<br>AMEX<br>Number: 6176292929<br>INVALID</pre> |
