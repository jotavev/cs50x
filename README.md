CS50 is a face-to-face and online computer science course at Harvard University.

This course is divided into weeks, and each week has a central topic and problem to solve.

I made this repository to show the things studied in this course.

## Lecture 0 (Scratch)

The week 0 is about principles of computers world 
- How to computer representing data (yes, with binary) 
- What is a algorithms 
- Time to solve problems (the bigO notation)
- ✨Scratch ✨

### Problem Set 0

In this class, I learned about scratch, and the proposed set of problems was to create something with scratch, and i made a game.

My project is a retro game, similar to pong, but for one player. To play, click [here!](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/778158229/)
